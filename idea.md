https://wikiwiki.jp/gakumas/%E5%88%9DLEGEND#p9b9fb77 This section tells you that there are totally 5 レジェンドレッスン

https://wikiwiki.jp/gakumas/%E5%88%9DLEGEND#g0767a81 This section tells you exactly how much parameters will increase, but these values are obtained under specific situation. The parameter can change based on what challenge P items the user choose. The information about challenge P items can be found from https://wikiwiki.jp/gakumas/%E5%88%9DLEGEND/%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8P%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0

We need to list out what will affect the final parameter obtained from each lesson, and provide user-friendly interface to fill in. 

Since this is just a web tool, it can be serverless and hosted by GitHub Pages. Therefore, TypeScript will be a good fit. Either Bun or nodejs can be chosen for the runtime. Use Tailwind CSS for our style.
